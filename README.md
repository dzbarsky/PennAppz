courseNemo
========

courseNemo is a web application that was designed and engineered at the PennApps 2013F hackathon by Maya Ebsworth, Oliver Manheim, Aliza Stone, and David Zbarsky. Nemo is a course discovery engine for Penn students, and can be used to generate new and diverse course recommendations based on a course the user has enjoyed. When a course is entered, Nemo utilizes an extensive database of courses, professors, departments, keywords, and more to establish and retrieve links to other courses that are relevant to the given course. The user then has the choice of approving or disapproving of a recommendation, saving a course for later, and continuing on to another recommendation. The user also has the option of simply requesting a randomly chosen course from all of Penn's course register.
